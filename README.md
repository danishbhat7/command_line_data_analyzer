# python command_line_data_analyzer

## Overview

This project is a Python-based command-line application that reads numeric data from a file,
validates the input, and performs basic statistical analysis without using external libraries.

The goal of this project was to strengthen core Python fundamentals such as file handling,
control flow, error handling, and manual implementation of statistical logic.


## Features

- Reads numeric data from a user-provided file
- Safely ignores invalid or non-numeric entries
- Computes mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation
- Interactive menu-driven command-line interface
- Filters values greater than or less than a given threshold

## How to Run


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danishbhat7/command-line-data-analyser.git

2. Nanigate into the project directory.

cd command-line-data-analyser

3. Run the program.

python command_line_data_analyzer.py

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Standard Library only (no external dependencies)

## What I Learned

- Structuring a program using functions and clear control flow
- Handling file input and invalid data without crashing the program
- Implementing statistical calculations manually
- Debugging logical errors related to scope, loops, and data handling
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing


## Future Improvements

- Support for biological data formats such as FASTA
- Exporting analysis results to a file
- Refactoring into a reusable Python module
- Adding automated tests
